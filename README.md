# Song-recommender

Project Background: Many users in Spotify listen to various songs which they like to hear,
but there are songs which they may like but aren’t aware of, our project attempts to solve this
issue by recommending songs to the user upon his/her liking of previous songs through K
Means clustering algorithm.

Project Overview: We have taken a Spotify dataset, which consists of songs over a century,
with various features pertaining to the song, we have done Data cleaning, EDA to get insights
about the data, and then we performed the most important step, i.e, applying K Means
clustering to the dataset to group similar songs into clusters, now given a person’s favorite song,
we used Recommendation system concept using cosine distance to recommend songs from the
corresponding cluster of that given song.
