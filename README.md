# Song-recommender

We have taken a Spotify dataset, which consists of songs over a century,
with various features pertaining to the song, we have done Data cleaning, EDA to get insights
about the data, and then we performed the most important step, i.e, applying K Means
clustering to the dataset to group similar songs into clusters, now given a personâ€™s favorite song,
we used Recommendation system concept using cosine distance to recommend songs from the
corresponding cluster of that given song.
